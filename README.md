# Machine Learning from a beginners perspective

## About the series

There are a lot of well written introductions, guides and so forth out there. So why write another? I've wanted to do a series on various machine learning techniques for while. Primarily because I want to learn more, and partly because I want to share that journey. I believe there are a lot of people who can benefit from having a deeper understanding of what machine learning is, without necessarily being the ones who are going to implement it in a production environment. Or becoming crack data scientists themselves.

What I aim to do with this series is therefore to show some techniques; beginning with a simple linear regression, and gradually moving on. As a beginner, I've done most of the steps manually (EDA, handling missing data, feature engineering etc.). For the first installment of the series (linear regression), I will do this the manually. For the rest of the series, I will use the tidymodels package, and functions like receipe, prep and bake etc. The workflow using a tidymodels approach will be explained.

I will cover the various types with readily accessible datasets, and for the most part I will be using the "Default" dataset from the ISLR-package. This allows us to compare different models as well. The markdown files will all be available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rlohne/ml-examples). Each method will be briefly explained, and I'll walk you through the steps, all with a beginners perspective.

## About the author

By background, I am a political scientist. I have a masters degree from the University of Bergen, and graduated in 2007. I don't have a strong math background; in fact, I hated math during my final high school years. When I started at University, I took some courses in social economics, but was turned back by the amount of math. In high school, I lacked the motivation to learn math at a deeper level, at uni, I lacked the understanding of the language.

After graduating, I went on to work as a management consultant. Gradually, I grew to love and understand analytics. I have done a fair bit of Six Sigma-related projects, and from this came a need to understand the methods on a deeper level. As I worked with larger and larger datasets, I outgrew Excel (literally in the sense that I worked with datasets in excess of 1 million rows). I was introduced to R, and spent some time as a untrained console warrior, alternating between the Console and History tabs in RStudio, and Stackoverflow. I never really understood what I was doing, but I mostly got things done.

In 2019 I started taking some courses, completing the "Data Scientist with R" course on DataCamp, as well as other courses and tracks. I started learning to use GitHub, and doing projects on my own as well as utilizing R in my everyday work projects.
